Here is the Reccomended page. Find songs based of the listed audio features. If you don't want a certain audio feature to be factored in, click the check box next to the respective slider.
Select genre using the carousel




### Search
If you want to look up song's audio features so you can use it as a reference look up a song on the search page, click on the album cover and the songs information will show up.

If you want to use that exact data in the Reccomended page hit the copy button on the right hand of the screen, and go to Reccomended page to paste info using the paste button that shows up when if any info is copied

Once you look something up on the Reccomended page a bunch of songs will show up and you can sample them by hovering over their album pic. (Warning not all songs have samples). Add the song to a playlist by clicking the button and the song will show up in the playlist tab. (Red means added)




### Playlist

This is how the songs show up in the Playlist tab. Add whatever song name you'd like. 
Make as many searches you like to add a combination of reccomended songs to your playlist
